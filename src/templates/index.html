        <h4>Dog Walker</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
         Growing up on a farm in Poland surrounded by various animals, I have always had a deep connection with pets. From chickens, pigs, horses, and cows to cats and dogs, caring for animals has been a passion of mine since childhood. After moving to Italy as a teenager, I rescued an abandoned dog and welcomed many cats into our countryside home. Now based in London for the past 10 years, I have transitioned from a career in hospitality to pursue my love for dogs. As a dedicated animal lover, I am excited to devote my time and affection to our canine companions. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, exploring new places, and taking long walks in nature.

          I can't say enough great things about Sophia and her excellent dog walking services. From the first time I met her, it was abundantly clear that Sophia is a true dog lover and has a natural rapport with furry friends of all breeds and sizes.  What sets Sophia apart is her incredible passion, patience, and attentiveness when it comes to caring for dogs. She doesn't just walk them - she provides excellent exercise tailored to each dog's unique needs and energy levels.</p>

          <h3>Simon</h3>
          <span style="font-size: xx-large;">â€œ</span>
          <p>Sophia has been walking Simon, my miniature Schnauzer, for a couple months now and I am really happy with her. She is on time, reliable and very good with Simon. She clearly loves dogs and mine loves her a lot. He is always very happy to see her and comes back tired and having had a lovely adventure. I can't recommend W4lkies highly enough.</p>

          <p>Sophia has been wonderful in looking after our dog Olly. He can be rather stubborn in nature and now slowing down with age, but Sophia has shown such great sincere attention, patience and care to Olly throughout. Always reliable and lovely daily updates too. ðŸ’¯ recommend!</p>
